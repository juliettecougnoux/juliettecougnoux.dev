      "description": "I work on backend projects built on <b>modular architectures</b> and technologies such as <b>Node.js, NestJS, GRPC, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</b>. \n My background in digital communication taught me how to bridge technology and user needs, translate requirements into concrete solutions, and collaborate effectively within multidisciplinary teams. \n Today, my work follows a philosophy of <b>responsible engineering</b>, where code quality, documentation, and knowledge sharing are essential. \n My core values: <b>rigor, kindness, transparency, and curiosity</b>. \n Above all, I strive for continuous improvement and technical precision in every project I build."

      "description": "As an experienced backend developer, I design and maintain robust, scalable technical architectures. \nWith a degree in <b>Digital Communication</b> (EJCAM – Journalisme and Communication School of Aix-Marseille), I first worked at the crossroads of <b>communication strategy and web development</b>, where I developed a passion for structure, logic, and code precision. \nThis dual background — between creativity and engineering — shapes the way I approach development today: understanding users, thinking in terms of product, and delivering reliable code. \nI work on both <b>Node.js/NestJS microservices</b> and <b>custom WordPress sites</b>, always with the same focus on performance, clarity, and maintainability."
